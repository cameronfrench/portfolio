# Portfolio

## Description

In this project, I designed and built a portfolio website so an employer can review samples of my work and assess whether I'm a good candidate for an open position. My design leaned more towards a minimalist design, yet still balanced, with focus on my work samples. The work samples include a feature project as well as two other projects to highlight various skills I've learned. The about me section and the contact section give an employer a brief over what I'm doing and how to best contact me.
